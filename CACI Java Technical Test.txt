The task is to create a simple system ordering system for a fictional organisation that sells bricks. No UI is required.

Please create a working system in Java which demonstrates these features.  Commit your code to a public Github repository and send the link to us.  We encourage you to commit you code often, at least at the completion of every story.

Your design should be guided by the tests you write (TDD). We're looking for strong OO design, unit tests and a clear implementation.

Please aim to spend 1.5 - 2 hours on this task.  We're looking for quality, not quantity.  The task is split into stages, we don't expect or need you to complete all the stages.

Stage 1

As a Rest Client
I want to submit new orders for bricks
So I can start customers’ orders

    Given
        A customer wants to buy any number of bricks
    When 
        A create Order request for a number of bricks is submitted
    Then
        an Order reference is returned
	And the Order reference is unique to the submission

As a Rest Client
I want to retrieve orders
So I can display simple customers’ orders

    Given
        A customer has submitted an order for some bricks
    When 
        A Get Order request is submitted with a valid Order reference
    Then
        the order details are returned
	and the order details contains the Order reference and the number of bricks ordered

    When 
        A Get Order request is submitted with an invalid Order reference
    Then
        no order details are returned


    Given
        Many customer have submitted orders for bricks
    When 
        A Get Orders request is submitted
    Then
        all the orders details are returned
	and the order details contains the Order reference and the number of bricks ordered

Stage 2

As a Rest Client
I want to update orders for bricks
So I can update customers’ orders

    Given
        A customer has ordered a number of bricks
    When 
        A Update Order request for an existing order reference and a number of bricks is submitted
    Then
        an Order reference the returned
	And the Order reference is unique to the submission

Stage 3

As a Rest Client
I want to note when orders have been dispatched
So I can manage when orders are fulfilled

    Given
        An order exists
    When 
        A Fulfil Order request is submitted for a valid Order reference
    Then
        the Order is marked as dispatched

    Given
        An order exists
    When 
        A Fulfil Order request is submitted for a invalid Order reference
    Then
        a 400 bad request response is returned

Stage 4

As a Rest Client
I want the prevent updates to an order, when that order has been dispatched
So I don't accept updates to orders that have already shipped

    Given
        An order exists
	and that order has been dispatched
    When 
        A Update Order request is submitted for a valid Order reference
    Then
        a 400 bad request response is returned
